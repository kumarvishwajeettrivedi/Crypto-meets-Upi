# Crypto Meets UPI: Unified Payment Revolution

The **"Crypto Meets UPI"** project demonstrates the integration of cryptocurrency transactions with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system. This innovation bridges the gap between decentralized digital assets and a centralized real-time payment system, offering users a seamless way to transact with crypto while leveraging UPI's widespread infrastructure.

## **Tools and Technologies Used**

| **Tool/Technology** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **ReactJS** | Frontend framework for building the user interface. |
| **Node.js** | Backend framework for API handling and server-side logic. |
| **Express.js** | Framework for creating RESTful APIs to manage transactions. |
| **MongoDB** | Database for storing user data and transaction records. |
| **Solidity** | For writing smart contracts for secure crypto operations. |
| **Metamask** | Browser wallet for managing and signing cryptocurrency transactions. |
| **Web3.js** | Library to interact with blockchain networks from the frontend. |
| **Razorpay API** | For integrating UPI payment functionality. |

## **Features**

1. **Crypto to Fiat Conversion**: Converts cryptocurrency into INR in real-time.
2. **UPI Integration**: Allows seamless fiat currency transfers via UPI.
3. **Smart Contract Security**: Ensures secure, trustless crypto transactions.
4. **User Authentication**: Verifies users before enabling transactions.
5. **Transaction Logs**: Maintains a transparent record of all operations.

## **How It Works**

1. **User Login**: Users authenticate using email or wallet credentials.
2. **Crypto Selection**: Users select a cryptocurrency and the amount to convert.
3. **Conversion Rate Check**: The app fetches real-time conversion rates via APIs.
4. **Fiat Deposit Request**: Users input UPI ID for depositing converted fiat.
5. **Transaction Execution**: Smart contracts handle the crypto deduction, and the backend processes the fiat deposit via UPI.
6. **Success Confirmation**: Both crypto deduction and fiat deposit confirmations are displayed.
